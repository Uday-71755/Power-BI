# Power-BI
Data Professional Survey Analysis.

In this project, I engaged with a comprehensive professional dataset obtained from an Excel file. The data was imported into Power BI, where I conducted essential data cleaning and transformation processes to ensure the integrity of the data for survey analysis. This included addressing missing values, standardizing formats, and eliminating inconsistencies. After the data was thoroughly cleaned and organized, I uploaded it into Power BI to develop an interactive dashboard. This dashboard was crafted to extract significant insights and provide visual representations that accurately depict the survey data. Key metrics and trends were emphasized through a variety of charts, graphs, and filters, facilitating improved decision-making and data-driven analysis.

This project showcases proficiency in data preparation, transformation, visualization, and narrative construction using Power BI.
